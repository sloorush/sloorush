So, I am a college student mostly, who likes food, travel and tech!

I am currently working on The Box, which is a subscription service based in India, Xpery.io, which is supposed a blogging platform made for people who love to travel! and <a href="https://khayaalipulao.r-ush.tech/">Khayaali Pulao</a>, which is a brain child of my khayaali pulao, basically a site where everyone can share all their weird ideas anonymously, nobody to judge you, get inspired or be an inspiration! Also working for The Byte Avenue, formerly known as CodePark.

Currently learning GraphQL, AWS, and Docker
